# Smallweb App Template

This template defines a basic structure for your smallweb app:

- your app public interface is exposed in `pkg/main.ts`
- the http server is defined in `pkg/server.ts`
- the cli command is defined in `pkg/cli.ts`

The app is structured to be easily publishable to [JSR](https://jsr.io). You can find the associated package at <https://jsr.io/@smallweb/app-template>.
